""" A config only for reproducing the ScanNet evaluation results.

We remove border matches by default, but the originally implemented
`remove_border()` has a bug, leading to only two sides of
all borders are actually removed. However, the [bug fix](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR/commit/e9146c8144dea5f3cbdd98b225f3e147a171c216)
makes the scannet evaluation results worse (auc@10=40.8 => 39.5), which should be
caused by tiny result fluctuation of few image pairs. This config set `BORDER_RM` to 0
to be consistent with the results in our paper.

Update: This config is for testing the re-trained model with the pos-enc bug fixed.
